Welcome to the [BotPack](https://replit.com/@jujutsu-high/Yuichi-BOT)ðŸŒ€ repository. This project is an unofficial bot file from the [Mirai](https://github.com/m1raibot/miraiv2) Repository, initially developed and maintained by [Pháº¡m VÄƒn Diá»‡n](https://github.com/D-Jukie/Disme-Bot.git), better known as [D-Jukie](https://github.com/D-Jukie). The base file for this project is sourced from the [Disme-Bot](https://github.com/D-Jukie/Disme-Bot.git) GitHub project.

[BotPack](https://replit.com/@jujutsu-high/Yuichi-BOT)ðŸŒ€ is a modified messenger bot file by [Max Spencer](https://replit.com/@yuichi192168)ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. It is a refined version of the Mirai messenger bot, with some unique enhancements. 

A key feature is the `usePrefix` function integrated within every command. This function removes the need for prefixes, providing a more streamlined user experience. Alongside ready-made commands and free-to-edit codes, this bot file encourages users to learn and explore freely.
